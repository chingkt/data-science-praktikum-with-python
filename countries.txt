argentina:
mask level unchanged over time, so no good clue for mask efficiency
travel restrictions lightened in early 2020. before the pandemic really started
lockdown lightened in late 2020. following increase in cases only after a 4 month delay
vaccination unlikely to reach critical amount in the 5 months before our data ends

brazil
mask mandate and lockdown didn't stop initial rise in cases
steep increase in cases later in the pandemic. with lockdown not in action anymore
vaccination unlikely to reach critical amount in the 4 months before our data ends

france
mask mandate through entire pandemic. unable to see pattern
travel restrictions before 1st wave seemingly not effective
lockdown through entire pandemic. unable to see pattern
vaccination might be key to declining cases from may forward with about 30% of adults vaccinated atleast once

saudi arabia
might be strong case for mask mandate as 1st wave seems to really decline as soon as masks are mandatory
travel restrictions for all of 2021 might help to keep cases of delta out 
lockdown active through entire 1st wave. 

south afrika
temporary tightening mask mandate and lockdown seems to have helped end the 2nd wave of pandemic
but did not stop the 1st
vaccination too late. not relevant


note: south america seems to struggle despite measures active. france and saudi arabia as the more "developed" countries seem to benefit more from vaccines 
south afrika might be the only country to end their 2nd wave with a temporary lockdown and mask mandate
